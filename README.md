# Vnote

A notebook for people who use pen tablets.

---

## Vision

To build an app for users to take hand written notes with their pen tablets.

Features that I am aiming for.

* Full notebook encryption
* Export selected, or all pages of a notebook as a pdf file.
* Desktop version using electron.js

The project was setup using `create-react-app`. So, `npm start` to run the app and `npm test` to test.
